![fruit shop image](images/Fruit-Site-original.png)

This site, made using React, is a store to buy fruits. The site utilizes Redux to keep track of what is added to or removed from the cart throughout the site's different pages.  

All the items and information are pulled from a MongoDB database and displayed on the page. Each item can be clicked to view more details about the respective item. In the cart page, the quantity of a particular item can be increased or decreased.

## To Add

- Add cart items to localstorage so that cart persists when reloading the site.
